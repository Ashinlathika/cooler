Project Overview
This project is a music player web page clone inspired by the Spotify web player interface. It allows users to view popular artists and albums, search for music, and explore the interface, although the functionality such as creating playlists and signing up is not yet implemented. The design is minimalist and responsive, providing a clean user experience that mirrors the look and feel of the Spotify platform.

Features
Sidebar Navigation: Includes access to the user's library, a button for creating a playlist, and a section for finding podcasts to follow.
Search Bar: A search input for users to explore music, artists, or albums (functionality is non-interactive in this version).
Popular Artists Section: Displays a list of popular artists with images and names.
Popular Albums Section: Displays a list of popular albums with cover art and names.
Sign-up Prompt: A footer section that encourages users to sign up for unlimited access to music (non-functional in this version).
File Structure
index.html: The main HTML file that structures the layout of the page.
style.css: The CSS file for styling the HTML elements, including the sidebar, main content, artists, albums, and footer.
script.js: JavaScript file handling simple interactivity, such as alerts for the "Sign up" and "Create playlist" buttons.

Project Components
1. HTML (index.html)
Contains the structure of the page, including the sidebar, popular artists, popular albums, and search bar.
The layout uses two main sections: aside for the sidebar and main for the content area.
2. CSS (style.css)
The design follows a dark theme similar to Spotify, with shades of black and grey.
Uses flexbox for a responsive layout, ensuring that the sidebar and main content area adjust appropriately based on screen size.
Includes styling for buttons, text, images, and the footer section.
3. JavaScript (script.js)
Handles the event listeners for two buttons:
Sign Up Button: Shows an alert that the sign-up feature is "coming soon."
Create Playlist Button: Shows an alert that the playlist creation feature is "coming soon."
The functionality for these features is currently limited to alerts as placeholders for future development.
Features to be Implemented
Sign-up Functionality: A user account system allowing users to register and log in.
Playlist Creation: The ability to create and manage playlists.
Music Search: Integration of a search functionality to allow users to search for specific songs or artists.
Music Playback: Adding a player to allow users to play, pause, and skip through tracks.
